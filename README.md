# **Personal Webpage**

this is the first webpage created, as from the beginning of the software development course. It is not expected to be much, though it carries a bountiful start of this career, from very little knowledge and its translation to the person I aim to become.

# Details of the Page.

It is a simple webpage comprising of the following:
    1. Home page
    2. About Me
    3. Testimonials
    4. Contact Area

The homepage is the center of all functionality and engagement with the site. 

About Me
This is where the real deal is. The persona of Njogu Michael in his uncovered nature. The career path, ambition and past histories. 

# Testimonials
The testimonials are a few words of the wise. People who saw me grow in this career and may put into perspective what the journey has been like.

# Contact Area
This includes various means to reach the author of the page. Among said means are social media handles,an formal email and contact numbers that are all functional.

# Functinoality of the site. 

This website has been built on html5 and javascript. The old ball and chain of website development. I chose to start here to show the evolution of the mind of this author in comparison with changes and strides in the technological industry.

The basic html and css code is a representaion of how things might be so simple yet make so much sense to a specific person.
